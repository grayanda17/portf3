		<h1>The Challenge</h1>

		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>Meal prep applications have taken a foothold in the current economy, with services like Blue Apron taking the work out of buying ingredients and planning dishes to cook.</p>
		<h2>Project Objective</h2>
		<p>Our team’s goal was to design, test, and pitch a new meal-prep service application to stakeholders and local venture capitalists at the end of 10 weeks. The meal-prep service would stand apart from existing applications with its emphasis on culturally informative, authentic, and time-saving pre-made meals.</p> 
		<h1>Our Approach</h1>
		<h2>Surveys and Competitive Analysis</h2>
		<p>In order to find an angle that would set our startup apart from existing competitors, our team relied on several rounds of qualitative data collection via online surveys and in-person interviews. My role as UX researcher required me to gather user data from a wide variety of angles in order to create a product best suited for our target audience. Before the idea of a “cultural meal prep service” was totally realized, our team had focused on creating a food service geared towards a health-conscious fitness lifestyle. Secondary research showed an enormous popularity in meal-prepping on social media and the target market seemed to span not only across gym enthusiasts, but students and young people trying to stay healthy while maximizing their time (Our surveys revealed that time was the biggest deterring factor to meal-prepping at home).</p> 
		<div class="content-item"><img src="../img/WP/mealprep.jpg" ></div>
		<!--<div class="content-item"><img src="./img/WP/fbsurvey.png" ></div>-->
		<div class="content-item"><img src="../img/WP/time.JPG" ></div>
		<p>Thus our initial service was “Fitbeet”, a meal-prep app that promised healthy meals pre-cooked and delivered to your doorstep. We had even tried to tap into the sharing economy to give users the option to meal-prep for other people. </p>
		<div class="content-item"><img src="../img/WP/fitbeet2.jpg" ></div>
		<p>The market for that end of our business model did not look very promising— if most users didn’t have time to cook for themselves, how could they have time to cook for others? Deeper research into fitness meal-plans also revealed that fitness diets are highly specialized and specific for each person. It was at this time that our group decided to pivot towards a more cultural meal-prep service, based on further survey data we acquired. From the 63 people surveyed, about 71% of them reported to feeling "very open" to exploring new cuisine, rating 5 on a 1-5 Likert scale.</p>
		<div class="content-item"><img src="../img/WP/cuisine.JPG" ></div>
		<p>From there, we conducted competitive analysis on cultural meal-prep services like Try The World, Eat Offbeat, Kitchen Table Passport, and Food Trotter. We compared and contrasted the features of each application, and found that the main limitations included sending snacks instead of perishable items, making users drive to pick up their meals, and a lack of cultural diversity.

		We intended for our service to make up for these shortcomings. Our service would provide pre-cooked meals to a certain radius, thereby ensuring freshness. Instead of opting for a huge cultural variety, we decided to market an educational approach by providing fact sheets about the dish and its culture. Our model would be business to person, facilitated through a mobile application.</p>

		<div class="content-item"><img src="../img/WP/pmod2.jpg" ></div>
		<br>
		<p>Our initial model had three stakeholders: 1) the user, 2) our business, and 3) local groceries and restaurants, who would receive advertising and referrals through coupons that our site would provide. Due to logistical issues in our in-person testing, we essentialized our model to a simple Business-to-Person format.</p>
		<h2>Storyboards and User Personas</h2>
		<p>We created storyboards to help illustrate the types of users we would have. From there, we fleshed out two main user personas: one more interesed in the novelty of food sampling, and the other more interested in the educational, cultural aspect of the experience.</p>
		<div class="content-item"><img src="../img/WP/personaboards.jpg" ></div>
		<div class="content-item"><img src="../img/WP/userpersonas.jpg" ></div>

		<h2>In-Person Testing</h2>
		<p>To see if our users' reception of the app would fall somewhere within either of these two personas, we needed to conduct in-person testing with prototypes of our applicaton. I was tasked with creating a viable but rough prototype of our experience. This included an authentic Filipino dish and several hand-selected facts about the dish and its connection to Filipino culture. To test the digital experience of our service, we piggyback prototyped using the app Messenger to send messages and recieve data from our test-users. We tested this experience with a handful of users whose feedback helped us iterate our design and fix minor hiccups regarding time between messages and delivering food.</p>

		<h1>Design</h1>
		<h2>Branding</h2>
		<p> A teammate and I were in charge of overseeing the app's branding. By gathering pictures of food and travel onto Pinterest moodboards, my partner and I were able to flesh out two distinct tones for our application. This lead to the creation of two separate color palettes: one to appeal to an older, sophisticated crowd, and the other to a more engergetic and youthful one. The latter seemed the most attractive due to its bright and whimsical color scheme, which would allow it to stand out among other competitors.  </p>

		<div class="content-item"><img src="../img/WP/design1.jpg" ></div>
		<div class="content-item"><img src="../img/WP/design2.jpg" ></div>
		<p>We then brainstormed app names and slogans by affinity-diagramming onto a word document, writing down any words related to food and travel that we could think of. "Wonderplates" won out, and with a name set for our startup, designing a logo took on more direction. In keeping with the theme of energetic whimsy, we converged on an almost child-like cutlery design which incorporated a ridimentary drawing of a globe. The logo was meant to riff off the saying "Having the world on a plate".</p>

		<h2>User Interface Mockups</h2>
		<p>Working with the two user personas created earlier, our team conducted A/B testing on our app's landing page. The layout of both sites was exactly the same, with a difference in header phrases. We were interested in seeing which phrase seemed more enticing to users. For the scope of the project, we did not contuct a statistical analysis; rather, we relied on in-person critiques from a large number of people. From this data, it was clear that version B was more appealing for its concise wording. <p>

		<p>The design elements from our branding endeavors were put into a mockup for our mobile application. </p>

		<h2>Startup Pitch</h2>
		<p>In order to present our startup to a panel of venture capitalists, our team needed to create a small commercial. I was tasked with script-writing, storyboarding, and video-editing. Using Illustrator, Photoshop, and Premiere Pro, I was able to draft storyboards, create mock delivery packaging, and edit a narrated 40-second pitch video. The video showcased exotic travel destinations and a user scenario of ordering and recieving meals through the Wonderplates app. </p>
