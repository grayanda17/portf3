		<h1>The Challenge</h1>

		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>UCSD has kept its tradition of hosting Sun God, an annual all-campus music festival, since 1983.  It is one of the longest standing campus events among the UC’s, and has featured artists such as Drake, Kendrick Lamar, Diplo, and Snoop Dogg.</p>
	

		<h2>Project Goals</h2>
		<p>This re-design was also intended to highlight the issues of campus disunity, and the deteriorating quality of student events in lieu of campus security. The “hoax” campaign would call for market research, convincing replication of the Sun God brand, physical and web advertising, and a curated website to enhance clicks to our Kickstarter petition.</p>
	

		<h1>Our Approach</h1>
		<h2>Initial  Research and Interviews</h2>

		<p>We gathered information on the physical and social systems that have been implemented to create a sense of campus disunity. This included political stances, cultural differences, and the lack of representation among subgroups of students. Interviews with students revealed that UCSD’s division into “six mini colleges” contributes to student isolation considerably. Furthermore, the campus’ layout plan revealed a major lack of campus-wide gather places.</p>

		<div class="content-item"><img src="./img/SG/UCSD_CAMPUS.jpg" ></div>
		<div class="content-item"><img src="./img/SG/sgresearch.jpg" ></div>

		

		<p>Upon further research, we discovered that recent Sun God Festival security protocols have used UCSD's segregated layout to their advantage. Students were only allowed access to their individual college, and were not allowed to visit other UCSD colleges during the festival. This rule applied to eveyone regardless of whether a student lived on-campus or not. What's more, most of Sun God Festival's budget had gone towards security, instead of the festival quality itself.Our group saw this as an opportunity to use Sun God festival as a case study to highlight student disunity in a single event. Our next step was to design drafts for a physical intervention that our target audience-- the student body-- would experience firsthand. </p>

		<h2>Rapid Prototypes</h2>

		<p>Initial drafts for a physical installation consisted of everything from deconstructing the campus mascot statue, to hosting fake campus tours, to instigating student riots. We quickly realized that designing an experience solely for reactionary purposes was not the way to go, and that for a wide-reaching campaign to be successful, we would need to take a softer approach that maximized visibility and reach. </p>

		<div class="content-item"><img src="./img/SG/sgdraft3.jpg"></div>

		<p>We then took the idea of UCSD’s inner-college segregation further, and decided to design new festival wristbands for each of the 6 colleges. Our first designs of handcuffs had meant to highlight how students are constricted in their interactions with each other during the festival. This idea, however, was scrapped in favor of a more believable approach. </p>

		<div class="content-item"><img src="./img/SG/sgdraft1.jpg"></div>
		<div class="content-item"><img src="./img/SG/sgdraft2.jpg" ></div>

		<p>We decided to work with a more traditional festival wristband design. To be printed on each wristband was the name of a college, the Sun God brand, and hour-long time slot when each college was intended to spend at the festival alone. This new addition was meant to exaggerate the sense of physical and social disunity throughout the UCSD campus.</p>

		<h2>Iterative Design and User Flow</h2>
		<p>Pre-festival distribution of these wristbands was bound to be a logistic issue, so working around this constraint, we decided we would maximize views by curating them on a website. To attract viewers, we would promote our website through physical advertisements posted around UCSD, as well as through Facebook and Instagram banners which we would design and pay for. The final user flow would be as follows: users would see the advertisements and follow the links to our webpage, where they would be presented with Sun God 2017’s satirical protocol and wristbands. At the end of the page, they would be prompted with the option to sign our Kickstarter petition for a more unifying Sun God experience. </p>

		<div class="content-item"><img src="./img/SG/flow.jpg"></div>

		<p>Our target market of tech and brand savvy college students required us to pay particular attention to the presenation of our ad campaign. My role as graphic designer and brand strategist was to make sure that the look of our brand was consistent throughout the user flow, and that it was believable and enticing enough to lure viewers. I decided a subtle approach of mimicking the current Sun God brand would create a sense of legitimacy and maximize conversions to our site. I studied that year's Sun God brand aesthetic, and from there, created two different poster designs to be printed and used online.</p>

		<div class="content-item"><img src="./img/SG/poster1.jpg"></div>
		<div class="content-item"><img src="./img/SG/poster2.jpg"></div>


		<p>Once on the site, the viewer is presented with cheerful messages of the new "rules" that students are intended to follow. We had intended for these rules to bring the current pracice of in-college segregation to light, as a suplement to our initial idea of time-slot festival wristbands. The wristbands are presented towards the end, and the viewer is made aware of the satire.</p>

		<h1>Impact</h1>
		<p>In 48 hours we were able to gather over 4,000 users to our site, over 100 petition signatures and multiple discussion threads on Reddit and other online forums. We had achieved our goal of bringing awarness and sparking discussion over a large target audience.</p>
